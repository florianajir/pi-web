"""OpenAI-compatible STT facade over Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 (onnx-asr).

Open WebUI's "OpenAI" speech-to-text engine posts the recording to one endpoint
on its configured base URL, so that is what this serves:

    POST /v1/audio/transcriptions   multipart: file, model, language -> {"text": ...}

`language` is accepted and ignored. Parakeet v3 has no language conditioning -
it was trained on 25 European languages and picks one acoustically - which is
the point here: whisper's failure mode on a short French clip is to decide the
audio is English and transliterate it, and there is no such decision to get
wrong. Nothing has to be configured when someone dictates a sentence in English.

Transcription is CPU-bound and holds the GIL, hence the single worker and the
lock: on this Pi the point is to never take more than the three cores llama-cpp
is already sharing.
