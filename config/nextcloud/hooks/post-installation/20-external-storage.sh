# Mount the qBittorrent downloads folder and the reading libraries as external
# storage so any file (not just photos, unlike Immich) can get a public Nextcloud
# share link. Restricted to the "admin" group.
# This runs once, right after a fresh Nextcloud installation. It is idempotent, so
# on an existing install it can be re-run by hand:
#   docker exec -u www-data pi-nextcloud sh /docker-entrypoint-hooks.d/post-installation/20-external-storage.sh
#
# Never exits non-zero: the nextcloud image's entrypoint aborts the container
# when a post-installation hook fails, and these hooks are never re-run (the
# version stamp lands before they do) — so a failure here would leave a fresh
# install permanently unable to start over a convenience mount. set -u only;
# every step is checked explicitly and failure logs a warning and exits 0.
