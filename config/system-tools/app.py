"""Read-only system status, as an OpenAPI tool server for Open WebUI.

Open WebUI injects every operation of the spec into the prompt of every message,
and this Pi processes prompts at ~40 tok/s - so the schema is a latency budget,
and so are the replies, which are re-processed on the next turn. One operation
with an enum costs 170 tokens, about +14 per topic added, where one extra
operation costs +72 on its own. `df -h` alone would cost ~400 in padding.

/proc and /sys are host-wide inside a container already; statvfs is not, which is
the only reason / is bind-mounted at /hostfs.

No endpoint takes a command, a path or a pattern, so an injected prompt has
nothing to steer.
