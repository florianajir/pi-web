"""Invariants compose.yaml must hold, checked against the rendered config.

Reads `docker compose config --format json` on stdin and prints one line per
finding, prefixed by category, for tests/compose-test.sh to assert on.

`docker compose config` inlines the contents of every `env_file:` - ntfy's
passwords and API tokens among them - so its output is a secret. project()
below reduces each service to the handful of fields the invariants need,
before anything else looks at it: what is not kept cannot be printed by a
failure message, now or after someone adds a check here. The caller also
passes --no-interpolate, which keeps ${PASSWORD} and the homepage widget keys
literal, and pipes straight into this script so the raw render never lands in
a shell variable.
