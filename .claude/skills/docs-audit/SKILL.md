# Documentation audit

Verify every factual claim in the docs against the files below, fix what is wrong,
and cut what is not useful. Never trust a doc's claim because it sounds plausible —
the drift that survives is exactly the plausible kind.

## Ground truth per doc

Read the source, then the doc — not the other way around.

| Doc | Verify against |
|-----|---------------|
| `README.md` | `compose.yaml` service list, `Makefile` targets |
| `docs/COMMANDS.md` | `Makefile` (targets, args, what each recipe actually runs) |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | `compose.yaml` (services, networks, volumes vs bind mounts), `${DATA_LOCATION}` layout |
| `docs/INSTALLATION.md` | `.env.dist`, `Makefile` `REQUIRED_ENV_VARS` + `install` recipe, first-run bootstrap scripts |
| `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` | `.env.dist`, compose `environment:` defaults (`${VAR:-default}`), the scripts a variable claims to drive |
| `docs/SECURITY.md` | Traefik labels in `compose.yaml` (middlewares per router, headers values), `config/authelia/configuration.yml.template` (access_control, session, OIDC clients), `scripts/authelia-pre-start.sh` (secrets) |
| `docs/NETWORKING.md` | compose `networks:` (subnets, static IPs, internal flags), published `ports:`, Pi-hole/Unbound config, `config/headscale/config.yaml` DNS block |
| `docs/MONITORING.md` | `scripts/uptime-kuma-bootstrap.py` (GROUPS), `scripts/beszel-agent-bootstrap.sh` (thresholds), `scripts/ntfy-pre-start.sh` (topics, accounts), `scripts/authelia-ntfy-watch.sh` |
| `docs/EMAIL.md` | compose SMTP env per service, `config/authelia/configuration.yml.template` notifier block |
| `docs/TAILSCALE.md` | `config/headscale/config.yaml`, tailscale service `TS_EXTRA_ARGS`, `Makefile` headscale targets, `scripts/headscale-init.sh` |
| systemd claims anywhere | `config/systemd/system/pi-pcloud.service` (which scripts run, pre vs post) |

`config/headscale/config.yaml`, `config/ntfy/ntfy.env` and `config/beszel-agent/agent.env`
are **generated/live files that may contain secrets** — read them for structure only and
never quote keys, secrets or tokens into a doc.

## Checks that have caught real drift

- **Enumerations complete**: every compose service appears in README's stack table,
  ARCHITECTURE's roles table, and SECURITY's per-service table; every
  `client_id` in the Authelia template appears in SECURITY's OIDC table with its
  real scopes and `authorization_policy`.
- **No invented values**: every IP, subnet, port, path, volume name, group name and
  timeout in a doc must exist in a config file. Grep the doc's literals against the
  repo; a value with no source is a fabrication to delete or fix.
- **Variable tables match `.env.dist`** plus compose `${VAR:-default}` fallbacks —
  both directions: no documented variable that nothing reads, no required variable
  missing from the docs (`Makefile` `REQUIRED_ENV_VARS` is the "required" list).
- **Commands run as written**: middleware lists, `make` targets, `docker compose exec`
  invocations (does that binary/script exist *in that container*, or on the host?).
- **Version-sensitive claims** ("X doesn't support Y") get re-checked against the
  pinned image version — upstream moves.
- **Anchors and cross-links resolve** after edits (`#section` targets, relative paths).
- **No real domain or personal data** — `<HOST_NAME>` placeholders only.

## What to remove

Generic filler that documents the internet instead of this stack: best-practice
listicles, per-provider recipes, OS-by-OS install walkthroughs, tutorial content for
upstream tools, diagrams restating a two-line fact. Keep the sections that record
*measured results and non-obvious decisions* (benchmarks, threshold rationale,
deliberate security exceptions) — that is the content only this repo can provide.

## Reporting

Summarize per file: what was factually wrong (with the correct value and its source),
and what was removed as filler. Distinguish verified-wrong from unverifiable; do not
"fix" a claim you could not check against a source.
