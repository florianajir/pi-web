# Installation

## Before you start

- A **Raspberry Pi 5** (8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended) running Raspberry Pi OS, ideally booting from an NVMe SSD.
- A **domain on Cloudflare** (free tier) and an API token with `Zone → DNS → Edit` on it — dashboard → **API Tokens** → Create token.
- **Docker and the Compose plugin.** The installer offers to install them if missing.
- Your router forwarding **`443/tcp`** to the Pi. Optionally `41641/udp` and `3478/udp` for direct VPN links.

## Guided install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/florianajir/pi-pcloud/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer:

1. **Checks prerequisites** — `git`, `make`, Docker, the Compose plugin; offers to install what's missing via `apt-get` / [get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com). A fresh Docker install requires logging out and re-running, since the `docker` group only takes effect at next login.
2. **Clones the repository** into `~/pi-pcloud` (`/opt/pi-pcloud` when run as root). Override with `PI_PCLOUD_DIR=/path`, or run it from inside an existing clone to reuse that checkout — it is fast-forwarded in place.
3. **Builds `.env`** from `.env.dist`, prompting only for what it cannot work out: domain, email, admin user, Cloudflare token and zone. Timezone and the whole network layout are auto-detected, and `PASSWORD` can be generated for you.
4. **Asks which services to run**, using the same picker as `make config` — everything pre-selected, grouped into sections, linked services toggling together. Core infrastructure always runs, and the choice can be changed any time. See [Choosing which services run](CONFIGURATION.md#choosing-which-services-run).
5. **Runs `make preflight`, then `make install`.**

Prompts use `whiptail` dialogs when available (it ships with Raspberry Pi OS) and fall back to plain terminal prompts otherwise, with identical behaviour. A host without `python3` skips step 4 and keeps every service enabled.

### What it detects, and when it asks anyway

The network layout is resolved before the first prompt, because macvlan gives Pi-hole its own LAN address and is picky about its parent:

| Situation | What happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| Parent interface is Wi-Fi, or a VPN tunnel owns the default route | Asks for confirmation — macvlan needs a wired parent |
| Subnet is not a `/24` | Asks for `PIHOLE_IP` explicitly |
| Something already answers a ping at the chosen Pi-hole address | Skips it and picks another |
| Layout cannot be determined at all | Asks before falling back to the `192.168.1.0/24` placeholders from `.env.dist` |

The fallback is all-or-nothing, so a half-detected layout is never mixed with placeholders. The installer stops if that confirmation is refused, and an unattended run also stops on an auto-detected Wi-Fi or tunnel parent — export `HOST_LAN_PARENT` to override, since nobody is there to read the warning.

### Re-running and unattended installs

It is safe to re-run: an existing clone is fast-forwarded, and an existing `.env` is never modified. `.env` only appears once fully configured, so an interrupted run restarts cleanly.

Any prompt can be pre-answered by exporting the variable first — `HOST_NAME`, `EMAIL`, `ADMIN_USER`, `PASSWORD`, `TIMEZONE`, `HOST_LAN_IP`, `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`. Exported network values (`HOST_LAN_PARENT`, `HOST_LAN_SUBNET`, `HOST_LAN_GATEWAY`, `PIHOLE_IP`, `ALLOW_IP_RANGES`) override auto-detection, and an exported `COMPOSE_PROFILES` skips the service picker — without it, a non-interactive run enables everything.

That makes fully unattended installs possible from a non-interactive shell:

```bash
export HOST_NAME=pi.example.com EMAIL=admin@example.com ADMIN_USER=admin PASSWORD='…'
export CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN='…' CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID='…'
export COMPOSE_PROFILES=nextcloud,immich-server,immich-machine-learning
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/florianajir/pi-pcloud/main/install.sh | sh
```

They need passwordless sudo (the Raspberry Pi OS default), since `make install` applies sysctl, `/etc/hosts` and systemd changes.

Values must satisfy the [`.env` value syntax rule](CONFIGURATION.md) — the installer and `make check-env` both enforce it through `scripts/lib.sh`, so a prompt and a later check can never disagree.

Optional settings (SMTP, S3 backups, `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`) are left empty; fill them in `.env` later.

## Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/florianajir/pi-pcloud.git
cd pi-pcloud
cp .env.dist .env       # fill in the required variables
make preflight          # Docker, Compose, cgroup v2, required commands
make install            # systemd units, secrets, containers, databases
make logs               # first startup takes 2–5 minutes
```

The variables you must set are listed in [Configuration → Required variables](CONFIGURATION.md#required-variables); `make check-env` validates them.

## First login

### 1. Create your users in LLDAP

Visit `https://lldap.<HOST_NAME>` and log in as `admin` with your `PASSWORD`.

- Create users under **Admin → Users**.
- Create an **`admin` group** and add your admin accounts to it. It gates the admin tools — Traefik, Pi-hole, Backrest, LLDAP, Dockhand, Headplane — behind 2FA. Regular users need no group at all.

### 2. Log in through the SSO portal

Visit `https://auth.<HOST_NAME>` and sign in with an LLDAP account. Admin users are prompted to enrol TOTP or a WebAuthn key on first access to a protected admin tool.

### 3. Open your services

Everything is wired to SSO already — just visit it and you'll be redirected to the portal:

`https://nextcloud.<HOST_NAME>` · `https://immich.<HOST_NAME>` · `https://vault.<HOST_NAME>` · `https://ai.<HOST_NAME>` · `https://beszel.<HOST_NAME>` · `https://uptime.<HOST_NAME>` · `https://n8n.<HOST_NAME>` · `https://dockhand.<HOST_NAME>`

`https://homepage.<HOST_NAME>` is a dashboard listing all of them, with live widgets. The full list with its protection model is in [Security](SECURITY.md#per-service-protection).

### 4. Kavita — one manual step

Kavita's OIDC connection is provisioned automatically (`scripts/kavita-oidc-bootstrap.sh` writes the client, secret and `appsettings.json`), but its **role mapping and account auto-provisioning live in its own database**, editable only through the UI. Once per fresh install:

1. Visit `https://kavita.<HOST_NAME>` and create the **admin account** by normal registration.
2. **Settings → OpenID Connect** — Authority, Client ID and Secret are already filled in.
3. Enable **Auto-Provision** so Authelia users get a Kavita account on first login.
4. Under **Advanced settings**, set **Roles claim** to `groups`. The default `.../claims/role` is not emitted by Authelia. Leave **Custom scopes** as `groups`.
5. To grant admin via SSO, put the user in an LLDAP group whose name matches a Kavita role (e.g. `Admin`), or set a **Roles prefix** such as `kavita-` and use groups like `kavita-admin`.

These persist in the `kavita_config` volume, and only these steps are manual: they gate everything else, because with **Disable password authentication** on there is no login a script can use until an admin exists.

Once that admin exists, the rest is provisioned on the next `make update`:

- `scripts/kavita-library-bootstrap.sh` creates the **Comics**, **Manga** and **Books** libraries with the right type and folders, repairs them if they drift, and adds every library to the OIDC default set so auto-provisioned accounts can see one added later.
- `scripts/homepage-widgets-bootstrap.sh` publishes a Kavita **API key** for the Homepage widget — the widget cannot use a password, since Kavita refuses password logins while OIDC is enforced.

Both read that key out of `kavita.db` (read-only — never edit it, the schema is not stable across Kavita majors) because `/api/Plugin/authenticate` is the only credential path left, and both skip with a warning until the admin account exists.

> Kavita's email settings have the same problem, but with OIDC + Auto-Provision they are usually unnecessary: they only power local-account flows (invites, setup links, password resets) that SSO bypasses. If you want them anyway, fill **Settings → Email** with your `SMTP_*` values from `.env`.

### 5. Shelfmark — pick your sources

Authentication needs nothing: `scripts/shelfmark-settings-bootstrap.sh` writes the Authelia
client into Shelfmark's `plugins/security.json`, password login is off, and the first
Authelia user to sign in is auto-provisioned (admin if they are in the `admin` group).
Prowlarr, qBittorrent, ntfy and SMTP are rendered into
`config/shelfmark/shelfmark.env` on every start, so those settings show as
environment-managed and read-only in the UI. Only discovered credentials and
service URLs go there: Shelfmark's environment outranks per-account settings as
well as the admin UI, so anything a user is meant to be able to change is
seeded as a plain default instead.

Two release sources are wired up:

- **Prowlarr indexers** work as soon as Prowlarr has some — add French trackers there
  and they appear as a release source. Nothing else to do.
- **Direct Download** (Anna's Archive) is on, seeded with one mirror,
  `https://annas-archive.gl` — upstream's recommendation, and the only candidate that
  was actually serving the site when this was written. Mirrors move; the list is
  **seeded, not enforced**, so edit it freely under **Settings → Mirrors** and the
  bootstrap will leave your version alone. `EXT_BYPASSER_URL` points at this stack's
  FlareSolverr, which solves the Cloudflare challenges those mirrors put up.
- **AudiobookBay and IRC** are the other audiobook sources; both need a hostname or a
  network only you can choose.

For audiobook *metadata*, set `HARDCOVER_API_KEY` in `.env` (free, from
[hardcover.app/account/api](https://hardcover.app/account/api)). Without it audiobook
searches fall back to Open Library, which is a book catalogue and carries almost no
audio edition data — see
[Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md#audiobook-metadata-hardcover).

A donator key (**Settings → Direct Download → `AA_DONATOR_KEY`**) removes the wait on
the slow download hosts. Without one, Anna's Archive queues you for a minute or two per
file, which is why `RELEASE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT` defaults to 300 s.

Per-account language: the stack seeds the default from `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`
(`fr-FR` → `fr`) on first start, and each user can override it for their own
searches. Seeded, not enforced — changing `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` later will not
overwrite a language you or a user has since chosen; adjust it under
**Settings → Search Mode**.

### 6. Audiobookshelf — nothing, unless you want a second admin

Fully provisioned by `scripts/audiobookshelf-bootstrap.sh` on the first start: the root
account (`ADMIN_USER` / `PASSWORD` from `.env`), the Authelia client, and an
**Audiobooks** library on `download/audiobooks/` — the folder Shelfmark files into.
Its metadata provider is the Audible storefront matching `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`
(`fr-FR` → `audible.fr`), because the catalogue is regional and a French audiobook is
invisible from `audible.com`. Change it under **Library → Edit → Metadata provider**;
the bootstrap seeds that value and never rewrites it.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Local login stays enabled** next to SSO. The root account is the only admin, SSO
  cannot create one, and it is the account you would need to get back in if Authelia
  were down. Its password is the one in `.env`.
- **SSO logins are matched to the root account by email.** If the LLDAP account you sign
  in with carries a different address than `EMAIL`, you get a second, plain-user account
  instead — see [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#books-and-audiobooks).
