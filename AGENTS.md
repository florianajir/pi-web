# Pi Pcloud

Pi Pcloud is a self-hosted web application stack designed for Raspberry Pi devices. It includes a variety of services for personal cloud such as Nextcloud, Immich, n8n, and monitoring solutions, all orchestrated using Docker Compose. The stack is secured with Tailscale and managed through Headscale for private networking.

## Guidelines

- Use docker compose for execution and management of services.
- Changes should be made in the docker compose file or the service configurations and scripts provided in the repository to ensure idempotency and functionality on fresh installs.
- Stack is run by systemd service, so the scripts in the scripts directory should be used for any pre-start, post-start, or pre-stop operations to ensure they run correctly in the service lifecycle.
- Makefile is provided for convenience.
- Never use make uninstall or any destructive operation on a path other than the project path.
- NEVER READ OR WRITE INSIDE THE .env file or any other *.env file (like config/gluetun/gluetun.env, config/homepage/homepage.env, config/lldap/lldap.env, config/ntfy/ntfy.env, ...), because it can contain sensitive information that should never be printed.
- Avoid creating new env vars in .env and .env.dist, use the provided configuration files and scripts to manage environment variables. For authentication, use ADMIN_USER and PASSWORD env vars. Never name a `.env` key `USER` (bare, no prefix) — it's a POSIX-reserved shell variable that Docker Compose's shell environment silently takes precedence over the `.env` file for, so any manual `docker compose` invocation from an interactive shell (where `$USER` is the OS login) shadows the intended value.
- Avoid adding new docker containers for running scripts that can be written in scripts directory and wired into the start sequence in `scripts/stack-up.sh` (pre-start or bootstrap)
- Scripts are POSIX sh (`#!/bin/sh`, run by dash) with `set -eu` — no bash, no bashisms (`local` is the one tolerated dash extension; initialize `local x=""` rather than declaring bare). Verify with `dash -n` and `checkbashisms`. Never dot-source `.env` (values with `;`/`#` execute as commands) — read keys via lib.sh `get_env_value`. `rotate-password.sh` deliberately has no `set -e`; see its header before "fixing" it. `pipefail` does not exist in dash: instead, validate the result of any `$(a | b)` substitution (non-empty / parseable) before writing it anywhere.
- Template rendering must be injection-safe: pass every substituted value through lib.sh `sed_escape` in `sed "s|…|…|g"` renders (a `|`, `&` or `\` in a password would corrupt or inject config), and render JSON with `jq --arg`, never sed.
- Never print sensitive information like .env content, passwords, or tokens in logs or stdout, use environment variables for handling sensitive data but keep it hidden.
- Before adding or bumping any image, chart, or dependency, check upstream for the newest release (registry tag list, GitHub releases, `docker buildx imagetools inspect`) and pin that version explicitly — never `latest`, never a tag copied from a neighbouring service without checking. Prefer the newest *stable* release: skip pre-release/rc/beta/nightly tags unless the feature we need only exists there, and say so when that's the case. Note the version you picked and where you verified it in the PR description.
- Write self-explanatory code instead of comments: explicit names, small functions, no commented-out code, no comments restating what the line already says. Keep a comment only when it explains a non-obvious *why* (workaround, upstream bug, ordering constraint, security implication). Before committing, re-read the diff and trim the comments you added down to that bar.
- Documentation follows the change, in the same change: when touching `compose.yaml`, `Makefile`, `config/` or `scripts/`, update the affected pages in `docs/` (and the README/ARCHITECTURE/SECURITY tables for anything user-visible). Never document from memory — verify every stated port, IP, variable, default, middleware and client list against the actual files, and never invent values the config doesn't contain. No generic how-to filler (SMTP provider recipes, OS install guides, best-practice listicles): docs describe *this* stack and the non-obvious decisions behind it. Use `<HOST_NAME>`-style placeholders, never a real domain. `/docs-audit` (`.claude/skills/docs-audit/SKILL.md`) is the periodic full sweep.

## Adding OIDC (Authelia SSO) to a service

Authelia is the OIDC provider. `data/authelia-config/configuration.yml` is RENDERED from `config/authelia/configuration.yml.template` by `scripts/authelia-pre-start.sh` on every start — never edit the rendered file, it gets overwritten. Do NOT build a custom image / Dockerfile to inject OIDC config; use a bootstrap script (guideline above). Steps:

1. Declare the client in `config/authelia/configuration.yml.template` (copy an existing stanza; use `__HOST_NAME__`, `{{ secret "/config/secrets/oidc_<id>_secret_hash" }}`, and the service's real redirect URI).
2. Add the client id to the secret-generation loop in `scripts/authelia-pre-start.sh` (generates `.txt` plaintext + `_hash` PBKDF2 automatically on fresh installs).
3. Configure the service itself with `scripts/<service>-oidc-bootstrap.sh`, sourcing `scripts/lib.sh` (reuse `ensure_authelia_oidc_materials`, `get_oidc_secret`, `wait_for_container`, `wait_for_http_endpoint`, `log`/`die`). Make it idempotent: only write/restart when config actually changed. Prefer the service's API; fall back to its config file (`docker exec` + `jq`) or DB when there's no API.
4. Wire it as `<service>:<service>-oidc-bootstrap.sh` in the `POST_START_HOOKS` list of `scripts/stack-up.sh` — the sequence the systemd unit and `make update` both run (the `<service>:` prefix gates it on `COMPOSE_PROFILES`; drop it for a core service). No systemd change is needed; `tests/stack-up-test.sh` fails if a hook script exists but nothing runs it.
5. If the service must reach Authelia's discovery endpoint from inside Docker, add `extra_hosts: ["auth.${HOST_NAME:-pi.lan}:172.30.11.250"]` to its compose service.
6. Traefik middleware: services with their own account system (Immich, Kavita) use `lan@docker` only — do NOT stack `authelia@docker` forward-auth on top.

## Adding a new service to the compose stack

Use the `add-service` skill (`.claude/skills/add-service/SKILL.md`): it walks through the
standard integrations — Traefik, Authelia OIDC, shared Postgres/Redis, ntfy, Uptime Kuma,
Backrest, Homepage labels, and the systemd bootstrap script.
