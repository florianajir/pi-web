# Consistent point-in-time copies of the stack's live SQLite databases.
#
# Runs as a Backrest CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_START hook, the SQLite counterpart of
# db-backup.sh. Without it, restic copies kavita.db and its -wal at different
# instants while the service is mid-write, so the restored pair can disagree.
# `sqlite3 .backup` takes a proper read transaction instead: the copy it writes
# is a single consistent state with the WAL already applied.
#
# The sources stay mounted read-only. That works because the owning service
# holds the database open, so the -shm index already exists and SQLite can map
# it read-only. A WAL-mode database with no -shm (checkpointed and closed, like
# beszel's auxiliary.db) cannot be opened read-only at all, because SQLite would
# have to create the -shm; see the immutable=1 fallback below. Anything that
# still fails is logged and skipped, and restic ships the raw files as before.
#
# Everything here is small (~35 MB total) and dedupes well between snapshots.
# Deliberately NOT listed:
#   - lldap, open-webui, nextcloud, immich, vaultwarden, authelia - on Postgres
#     in this stack; db-backup.sh already dumps them. Their leftover .db files
#     are stale stubs and restoring one would be actively misleading.
#   - kavita/cache.db, prowlarr/logs.db, pihole-FTL.db - caches and logs the
#     service rebuilds by itself.
#   - pihole/gravity.db - 99.99% regenerable (670k downloaded block domains
#     against ~67 rows of actual configuration), so it gets a config-only SQL
#     dump instead; see GRAVITY_TABLES below.

# The copies carry account tables and API keys; keep them out of group/other
