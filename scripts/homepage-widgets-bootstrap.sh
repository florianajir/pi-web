# Bootstrap Homepage service widgets: extracts/creates the API keys that
# gethomepage.dev's built-in widgets need, and writes them as single-line
# secret files under config/homepage/secrets/. Every widget secret lives there,
# including the one nobody can mint (Immich), so there is a single place to look
# and no env_file for Homepage at all. That directory is already
# visible inside the homepage container at /app/config/secrets (it's a
# subpath of the existing ./config/homepage:/app/config mount), and is
# referenced from compose.yaml via HOMEPAGE_FILE_* env vars, which Homepage
# substitutes as {{HOMEPAGE_FILE_x}} in widget labels.
#
# Runs last in the post-start chain (after Prowlarr/Headscale are already
# bootstrapped by their own scripts). Idempotent: only (re)writes a secret
# file if the value changed, and only restarts homepage if something did.
