# Bring Audiobookshelf up to a usable state without anyone touching its setup
# wizard: create the root account, point it at Authelia over OIDC, and add the
# audiobook library.
#
# A post-start hook (scripts/stack-up.sh). Idempotent and best-effort: every step
# checks the current state first, and a failure warns rather than failing the
# stack start.
#
# Audiobookshelf keeps all of this in its own SQLite database and exposes no way
# to seed it from the environment or a config file, so the API is the only door -
# and the API needs an account, which is why /init comes first.
#
# That account's password is also what OIDC replaces: once SSO works, local
# logins are switched off, and from then on the only credential this script
# holds is the API key it minted for itself while they were still on. So the
# order below is not cosmetic - ensure_api_key must succeed before
# configure_oidc drops `local`, or the next run has no way back in.
