# Migrate the shared Postgres cluster to a new major version, by dump/restore.
#
# One step of the procedure in docs/POSTGRES-UPGRADE.md, which covers the
# pre-flight checks, the Backrest client bump this needs alongside it, and the
# post-cutover verification. Read that first.
#
# Usage: pg-major-upgrade.sh --to <image> [--apply] [--keep-dumps]
#   --to <image>   target image, e.g.
#                  ghcr.io/immich-app/postgres:18-vectorchord1.1.1@sha256:...
#   --apply        rewrite compose.yaml's postgres image and data mount on
#                  success (otherwise the two edits are printed for review)
#   --keep-dumps   do not delete the dump directory afterwards
#
# Why dump/restore rather than pg_upgrade: the immich-app/postgres image ships
# exactly one major's binaries, so pg_upgrade (which needs both) would require
# a custom image carrying two Postgres builds plus VectorChord. A dump/restore
# also rebuilds the vchord indexes at the new extension version, which is what
# Immich's docs otherwise ask you to do by hand after any vchord change.
#
# The old data directory is never touched: the new major initialises a fresh
# one, so rollback is reverting the two compose lines. From Postgres 18 the
# upstream image stores data under /var/lib/postgresql/<major>/docker instead
# of /var/lib/postgresql/data and refuses to start with anything mounted at
# the latter, so the mount point moves with the version.

# and a table too small to trip the autovacuum threshold can carry a figure
# that was never right. On this stack lldap.groups read 0 against 4 real rows
# and lldap.users read 2 against 5, with last_analyze and last_autoanalyze both
# NULL. A freshly restored cluster, by contrast, has accurate counts because
# the collector just watched every INSERT — so estimate-vs-exact compared as if
# they were the same thing, and reported a clean migration as data loss.
#
# Sampling the top N by that estimate compounded it: the two sides then chose
# *different sets of tables*, which surfaced as "table absent after" for a
# table that was present and correct. Counting everything also catches a table
# that failed to restore at all, which a top-N sample can miss entirely.
