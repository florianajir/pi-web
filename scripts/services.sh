# Manage optional pi-pcloud services through Docker Compose profiles.
#
# Every optional service in compose.yaml carries a profile named after itself
# (plus the catch-all "all"); COMPOSE_PROFILES in .env selects which run. A
# missing line means everything (pre-profiles installs); an explicitly empty
# value means core-only, matching what docker compose does with it.
# Enabled-ness is computed with `docker compose config --services` under the
# current selection, which is authoritative and handles coupled profiles
# (e.g. stremio auto-enabling gluetun) for free.
#
# Subcommands:
#   list               List optional services and whether each is enabled
#   enable <service>   Add to COMPOSE_PROFILES, start it, run its init hooks
#   disable <service>  Remove from COMPOSE_PROFILES, stop and remove it
#   config             Interactive picker (scripts/services-picker.py)
#   pick               Same picker, printing the chosen COMPOSE_PROFILES value
#                      instead of applying it (used by install.sh)
#   names              The optional service names, one per line (completion)
#
# enable (and config, for newly-enabled services) runs the same per-service
# hooks the systemd unit runs around `docker compose up`:
#   scripts/<svc>-pre-start.sh                      before starting
#   scripts/<svc>-bootstrap.sh, <svc>-oidc-bootstrap.sh   after starting
# Hooks are found by filename convention, never hardcoded, so future services
# get theirs automatically. Post hooks tolerate failure, like the systemd
# unit's `-` prefix does.
#
# DRY_RUN=1 prints the docker/hook commands and the would-be .env line
# instead of executing/writing anything. ENV_FILE=<path> (honored by lib.sh)
# points at another env file, mainly for tests; the effective selection is
# always passed to `docker compose up` explicitly so it never depends on
# which .env compose happens to read.
#
# Host-only: this script is never mounted into containers, so sourcing
# lib.sh is fine here (scripts that backrest mounts must not source it).
