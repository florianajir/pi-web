# Watch the Authelia container log for failed authentication attempts and publish
# them to ntfy. Runs as a long-lived host service (pi-pcloud-authelia-ntfy.service),
# so no extra container is needed.
#
# Authelia has no webhook/event notifier (its notifier is SMTP-only, for user mails),
# so the log stream is the integration point. Matched messages:
#   Unsuccessful <method> authentication attempt by user '<user>'
#   Unsuccessful <method> authentication attempt by user '<user>' and they are banned until <time>
#   Error occurred getting details for user with username input '<user>' which usually
#     indicates they do not exist
#   Access Request failed with error: <reason>
