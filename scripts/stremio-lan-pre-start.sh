# Check Stremio's macvlan address before the stack tries to claim it.
#
# STREMIO_IP arrived with the stremio-lan profile, so an .env written by an
# earlier install does not carry it and compose falls back to .env.dist's
# 192.168.1.251 (compose.yaml, `ipv4_address: ${STREMIO_IP:-192.168.1.251}`).
# On any other LAN that address is outside the macvlan pool and `up` fails with
# "Invalid address ... does not belong to any of this network's subnets", which
# says nothing about which variable to set. install.sh derives the value for a
# fresh install; this is the same check for every .env that predates it.
#
# Blocking on purpose (see PRE_START_HOOKS in stack-up.sh): the address is
# wrong, not missing, and starting anyway only produces the cryptic failure.
