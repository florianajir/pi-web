"""Interactive picker for the optional services of the stack.

Usage: services-picker.py <rows-file> <out-file>

The rows file holds one service per line, as
"service:section:companion-of:needs:conflicts-with:state:description",
as produced by scripts/services.sh (which owns everything else: reading
compose.yaml, writing .env, running the per-service hooks). This script only
lets the user choose, then writes the services that stay ticked to the out
file, one per line. Exit status is 0 on confirm, 1 on cancel.

Files rather than stdio: curses owns the terminal, so a captured stdout would
either swallow the UI or the result.

Three relations reach us, and they are deliberately different. `companion-of` is
"pointless on its own" -- comet only makes sense with stremio, n8n-runners with
n8n -- and is drawn as an indented row. `needs` is "cannot run without", which
crosses sections: qbittorrent is a download service listed under Download, but
it runs inside gluetun's network namespace. `conflicts-with` is the opposite:
stremio and stremio-lan are one server in two networking modes and cannot both
run. Toggling propagates along all three, transitively, so the screen always
shows a set the stack can actually run.
