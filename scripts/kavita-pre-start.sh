# root:root - which Kavita could still read, but qBittorrent (PUID 1000) could no
# longer write the matching category into. Create them up front and hand them to the
# project owner. Idempotent. comics/ and manga/ - the top-level ones, not the
# download/ ones below - are Kapowarr root folders and belong to kapowarr-pre-start.sh.
# A pre-start hook (scripts/stack-up.sh), so it runs before docker compose up.
