# Keeps the two entries of the `lan@docker` allowlist that the ISP owns - and
# so expire without warning - equal to what the line presents right now, in
# .env and in the running Traefik:
#
#   WAN_HAIRPIN_IP    this line's public IPv4, as a /32
#   HOST_LAN_SUBNET6  the IPv6 prefix delegated to the LAN
#
# What each admits and why it is needed at all: docs/NETWORKING.md,
# docs/SECURITY.md.
#
# A timer rather than a one-off because both expire with the line, and a stale
# entry keeps allowlisting whoever inherits the address.
#
# The IPv4 address comes from `tailscale netcheck` - a STUN observation of what
# the line presents *now*, which is exactly what the router SNATs a hairpinned
# connection to. ddns-updater's state file is the obvious source and the wrong
# one: it records what was last *published*, and is only rewritten when that
# changes, so it reports agreement forever once publishing has broken.
#
# The IPv6 prefix comes from the LAN interface's routing table, for the same
# reason. There is no hairpin to observe over IPv6 - with no NAT a LAN client
# reaches the Pi's global address directly - so what has to be allowlisted is
# the prefix its neighbours draw their addresses from.
