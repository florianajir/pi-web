# Configure the Shelfmark settings that live in its own config files rather than
# in its environment: the Authelia OIDC client, the proxy that puts direct
# downloads on the VPN, the Hardcover audiobook metadata provider, and the
# Anna's Archive mirror list.
# A post-start hook (scripts/stack-up.sh). Idempotent: it writes, and restarts
# Shelfmark, only when something actually differs.
#
# Shelfmark keeps each settings tab in /config/plugins/<tab>.json
# (shelfmark/core/settings_registry.py) and resolves a setting from the
# environment first, then from that file. It has no unauthenticated API to set
# them, which is the chicken-and-egg this script exists to break. Everything
# that can safely be an env var already is one, on the service in compose.yaml;
# what lands here does so for a reason, noted per section below.

    # The emptiness test has to be the shell's, not jq's: `jq -e` reports success

#     wins" over a per-user override (core/config.py get). Setting it there
#     would freeze every account's provider choice instead of moving the
#     deployment default, which is all this is meant to do.
