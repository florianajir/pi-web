# Gate per-service pre-start/bootstrap work on COMPOSE_PROFILES.
#
# Usage:
#   run-if-enabled.sh <service> <command> [args...]
#       Exec <command> if <service> is enabled; otherwise print a short
#       skip notice and exit 0 (so blocking ExecStartPre lines pass).
#   run-if-enabled.sh <service>
#       Test mode: exit 0 if enabled, 1 if disabled. Meant for systemd
#       ExecCondition, where a 1..254 exit skips the unit without failing it.
#
# A service is enabled when the comma-separated COMPOSE_PROFILES list contains
# "all" or the exact service name (no substring matching; spaces around
# entries are tolerated). A defined-but-empty value disables every optional
# service, matching what docker compose does with it (core-only). Only when
# COMPOSE_PROFILES is defined nowhere (an install predating per-service
# profiles) is everything treated as enabled.
#
# When COMPOSE_PROFILES is not set in the environment (a unit without
# EnvironmentFile=, e.g. nextcloud-cron.service), it is read from the .env
# file in this script's parent directory instead.
#
# Deliberately self-contained: does NOT source lib.sh, so it stays usable
# from minimal contexts (some repo scripts are mounted into containers).
