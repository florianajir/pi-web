"""Bootstrap Uptime Kuma 2.x: setup admin, disable built-in auth (Authelia handles it),
configure the ntfy notification tiers, docker host, and the monitor topology.

Monitors are organised in seven groups under the "pi-pcloud" root, split by blast
radius rather than by theme, because in Kuma the alerting granularity is per
monitor: the group a monitor lives in decides its check interval, its retry
budget and which ntfy priority it wakes you up with.

Each group also declares where the notification is attached:

  notify="children"  every monitor alerts on its own (precise message, used for
                     the tiers where you want to know exactly what broke)
  notify="group"     only the group monitor alerts, children stay silent. A Kuma
                     group is a worst-of-children aggregate whose down message
                     lists the failing children, so a gluetun outage sends one
                     "Child monitors down: qbittorrent, prowlarr, ..." instead of
                     six separate pushes.

Beside the per-container docker monitors (which only prove the container runs),
the topology adds end-to-end checks that exercise the actual request path:
HTTP monitors sent to Traefik with a Host header, a DNS resolution check through
Pi-hole, the gluetun public IP, and the age of the last backup. Those catch the
failure modes a docker check is blind to - a dropped Traefik route answers 404
while the container is happily running, and a backup that never started reports
nothing at all.

Optional services are profile-gated (COMPOSE_PROFILES in .env). Every monitor
is still created, but a monitor owned by a disabled service is paused rather
than deleted - pausing keeps its heartbeat history - and resumed when the
service is enabled again. The enabled-service list is computed on the host by
uptime-kuma-bootstrap.sh (docker compose is the authority on profiles) and
passed in as ENABLED_SERVICES; when it is empty or missing, nothing is paused
or resumed, so a plumbing failure can never silence real alerting.

Uses direct Socket.IO calls for Uptime Kuma 2.x compatibility.
