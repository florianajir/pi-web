# Copy the live .env into the backed-up tree, as a Backrest
# CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_START hook.
#
# Why a copy and not a bind mount of ./.env: a single-FILE bind mount pins the
# inode. Every writer in this repo replaces .env rather than rewriting it -
# services.sh's write_profiles and rotate-password.sh both use `sed -i`, which
# writes a temp file and renames, and most editors do the same. Neither
# recreates backrest, so the container would keep the pre-edit inode and every
# later snapshot would silently ship a stale .env. Reading it by name out of a
# read-only mount of the project directory picks up whatever is there now.
#
# It also removes a sharp edge: with ./.env bind-mounted as a file, a
# `docker compose up` run when .env is missing makes Docker create ./.env as a
# DIRECTORY, which then breaks every get_env_value in scripts/lib.sh.
#
# This can NEVER be the only copy of .env: restoring it needs
# BACKREST_S3_REPO_PASSWORD, which is inside it. Keep an offline copy - see
# docs/MONITORING.md.
