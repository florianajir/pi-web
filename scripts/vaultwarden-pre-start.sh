# Generates the Vaultwarden /admin credential: a random token plus the Argon2id
# PHC digest that is all the container ever sees.
#
# Vaultwarden accepts a plaintext ADMIN_TOKEN but logs a NOTICE about it on every
# start, and wants a PHC string instead. Hashing has to happen out here because
# neither tool that can produce one takes the secret on stdin: `vaultwarden hash`
# reads from /dev/tty, and Authelia's CLI requires --password on argv.
#
# The token is deliberately NOT derived from PASSWORD. /admin sits behind the LAN
# allowlist with no Authelia forward-auth in front of it, so reusing the SSO
# password would turn a PASSWORD leak into an admin-panel compromise. Like the
# OIDC client secrets and the ntfy passwords, rotate-password.sh leaves it alone.
