# Rotate the shared PASSWORD (.env) and push the new value into every service
# that actually stores its own persisted copy, not just the ones that read
# ${PASSWORD} fresh from the environment at container start.
#
# Use this after PASSWORD has been exposed (leaked, shoulder-surfed, committed,
# etc). It does NOT rotate ADMIN_USER, EMAIL, or any of the independent
# per-service secrets (NTFY_*_PASSWORD, OIDC client secrets, S3/backup keys) -
# those aren't derived from PASSWORD and don't need touching here.
#
# Lessons baked in from doing this rotation live on this exact stack once:
#   - The LLDAP admin account's password is NOT "self-healing" on container
#     recreate, despite docs/CONFIGURATION.md's old claim. Recreating lldap
#     with a new LLDAP_LDAP_USER_PASS does nothing to the already-provisioned
#     admin user. The only way to actually change it is the LDAP
#     password-modify extended operation (ldappasswd), authenticated with the
#     OLD password.
#   - Authelia's real Postgres credential is the `db_password` SECRET FILE
#     (referenced by configuration.yml.template), not the AUTHELIA_DB_PASSWORD
#     env var in compose.yaml (that env var is effectively vestigial/unused by
#     Authelia itself). Writing it before the `authelia` Postgres role is
#     actually rotated makes Authelia crash-loop on DB ping.
#   - Nextcloud's DB password lives in config.php, written once at install.
#     You MUST update it via `occ config:system:set dbpassword` while the OLD
#     Postgres role password is still valid (i.e. BEFORE rotating the
#     `nextcloud` role), or Nextcloud loses its DB connection in the gap.
#   - .env's PASSWORD feeds Postgres connection strings for lldap,
#     immich-server, open-webui, vaultwarden, and backrest, AND local-login
#     fallbacks for pihole/homepage/comet. Writing a new PASSWORD into .env
#     without also rotating the Postgres roles those services hold poisons .env
#     for a FUTURE, unrelated container recreate (a reboot, `make restart`, an
#     image bump) to break on - so --skip-postgres mode never touches .env at all.
#   - The authelia-config/secrets directory can end up owned by root (this
#     stack's systemd unit runs docker compose as root, and some root-run init
#     path can flip ownership between edits). Secret-file writes below try a
#     plain write first and fall back to sudo.
#
# Best-effort past the Postgres/LDAP/Authelia core: a partial rotation you can
# read the report for is safer to recover from than one that dies halfway with no
# summary. Fix up anything marked FAILED manually.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/rotate-password.sh [--yes] [--skip-postgres]
#   --yes             Skip the interactive confirmation (the Makefile target
#                      already confirms before calling this, so it passes
#                      --yes).
#   --skip-postgres    Rotate only the LLDAP admin account + Authelia's
#                      matching ldap_password secret (the actual SSO master
#                      credential). Touches nothing else, .env included - see
#                      the .env bullet above.
