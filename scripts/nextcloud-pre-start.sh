# Pre-start: let Nextcloud organise the media libraries it mounts, not just
# share them.
#
# Making those bind mounts read-write in compose.yaml is necessary but not
# sufficient. Nextcloud's PHP runs as uid 33 (www-data) while everything under
# DATA_LOCATION belongs to uid/gid 1000 in mode 0755, so uid 33 would still get
# r-x and could not create, move or delete anything - the Files app would show
# a permission error on every attempt. compose.yaml puts the container in gid
# 1000 via `group_add`; this hook is the other half, granting that gid write
# access to the tree.
#
# POSIX ACLs rather than `chmod -R g+w`, because a chmod does not survive. The
# services that fill these folders - qBittorrent, Kapowarr, Shelfmark - all run
# with umask 022, so every directory they create afterwards would come back
# 0755 and Nextcloud would silently lose access to exactly the new downloads it
# is most likely to be asked to tidy up. A *default* ACL is inherited by
# whatever is created later, umask notwithstanding, which is why it is set here
# instead of chasing a UMASK setting through four different images.
#
# `rwX`, not `rwx`, for the access entry: capital X grants execute on
# directories only, so files do not come out spuriously executable.
#
# A pre-start hook (scripts/stack-up.sh). Idempotent, and cheap enough to run
# every boot - the whole tree is a few hundred entries.
